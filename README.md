Sometimes, despite your best efforts, a document gets very large and hard to navigate, and for whatever reason,
the language server can't help you navigate. This extension provides commands to let you go to a specific section
of a document, or to go to the previous or next section.

A section is defined by a line of text that starts with a section indicator, optionally followed by some text
terminated by a newline.
